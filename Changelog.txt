Changelog

In-game:
- Removed custom daedric tile set, as it was incompatible with retexture mods and had no real benefit. Regular daedric tileset is used instead.

Project Structure
- Merged TU2 project and Patch Project together.

Assets
- Sanitized texture filepaths for all meshes.
- Used TESFiles to find and remove unused assets (150 files), reducing package size.
- Removed Better Bodies meshes which could overwrite user mod assets (original BB or other BB-like mods) and relocated to subfolder.
- Removed some invalid NIF files which could crash the game (Why is an MP3 being called a NIF anyways, Qarl?)
- Optimized textures via Ordenador. Reduced package size by ~580MB.
- Optimized meshes by reducing duplicate vertices in many meshes.
